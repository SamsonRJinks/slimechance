(I used to read a lot when I was younger, so the literature club was a good pick! Hm... Jellia said they meet in the library, but I don't see many people around, other than that girl in the corner. )

Um... excuse me...?

#Literature_03#
Slimeantha
Oh I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hover!
#End#

#Literature_04#
???
Aaaa! N-no, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your hovering- ah, I mean...
#End#

#Literature_05#
Slimeantha
(Uh oh, this is kind of awkward... She seems super embaressed.)
#End#

#Literature_06#
Vaselle
(Ah, I'll just ask her where the Literature Club is, I can't take this silence anymore! >x<)
#End#

#Literature_07#
Slimeantha
Um, hey, I heard the Literature Club meets here, but it doesn't look like anyone is- (Wait... oh NOOOOOO! ;0;)
#End#

#Literature_08#
Vaselle
Um... you're in the right place... I'm Vaselle, Club President. Sorry if I'm in your way, I'll move-
#End#

#Literature_09#
Slimeantha
(Darnit, no! This isn't how this is supposed to go, we've barely even started! I have to save this!)
#End#

#Literature_10#
Slimeantha
ACTUALLY- oh sorry, forgot we were in a library. Uh, actually, I wanted to talk with YOU Vaselle!
#End#

#Literature_11#
Vaselle
O-oh! Uh, I see, well, this is... oh my gosh, I'm a bit embarresed...
#End#

#Literature_12#
Slimeantha
(Wait... Is she...? 0////0)

It's been so long since a new member joined!

Vaselle
...You're not here to join...
#End#

#Literature_18#
Slimeantha
Sorry, no. I'm actually hear to talk to you about the upcoming student council election- could I talk to the other members as well?
#End#

#Literature_19#
Vaselle
The other members only really come on Fridays... It's a literature club, and you can read anywhere, so they only need to be here to talk during our weekly discussion.
#End#

#Literature_20#
Slimeantha
(AAAAAAAAAAAAA FRIDAY IS THE WORST DAY, THAT'S WHEN THE DEBATE WILL BE GOING ON!!!)
#End#

#Literature_21#
Slimeantha
Uh, sorry to hear that... What're you reading this week, if you don't mind me asking?
#End#

#Literature_23#
Slimeantha
(Darnit, that's the lamest thing I could have said, she probably doesn't want to talk about her book now that the mood is so awkward! DX)
#End#

#Literature_24#
Vaselle
Oh... uh well, I'm sorry, I'm still reading it so I don't know how it ends, but it's a classical novel about the rise of IMPERIALISM in the Western world and it's ties to the spice trade during the 1800s. The main character is a young girl that was born out of WEDLOCK, and now lives with her step-mother in a city in the Carribean, where she's starting to recognize the importance of her heritage. But see, the REALLY interesting developments start around Chapter 4, where the main character realizes her step-mother is planning to DISOWN HER so she can remarry someone with a higher social standing. In the dead of night...

#Literature_25#
Slimeantha
(Wow, she REALLY opened up now. I'm having trouble following the plot, but the sparkle in her eye is really something.)
#End#

#Literature_26#
Vaselle
...you, Slimeantha?
#End#

#Literature_27#
Slimeantha
Sorry, what?
#End#

#Literature_28#
Vaselle
What about you? Do you read a lot?
#End#

#Literature_29#
Slimeantha
Not as much as I probably should, haha... I used to read during study hall, but that was back in middle school.
#End#

#Literature_30#
Vaselle
Yeah... I miss those days... 
#End#

#Literature_31#
Slimeantha
Wait, you mean middle school?
#End#

#Literature_32#
Vaselle
Uh, yeah... It's a little embarressing, but the teachers didn't pay as much attention to me back then, so I'd read books in class and during breaks.
#End#

#Literature_33#
Vaselle
It was against the rules, but they didn't care as long as my grades were good.
#End#

#Literature_34#
Slimeantha
Wow! You must be super smart, then!
#End#

#Literature_35#
Vaselle
Oh, um, I do ok, I think? I'm kind of bored in study hall b/c I finish my homework so quickly, though. I wish I could come here, it's so quiet and there aren't too many people around usually.
#End#

#Literature_36#
Slimeantha
(Huh, yeah... I think I understand the appeal of that.)
#End#

#Literature_37#
Slimeantha
(Wait... THIS COULD BE IT!)
#End#

#Literature_38#
Slimeantha
Well, what if I made that happen?
#End#

#Literature_39#
Vaselle
Wh-what?
#End#

#Literature_37#
Slimeantha
Like, uh, I could make that one of my council rule proposals. It wouldn't hurt anybody, so I can't imagine it'd make a big difference. Would that be ok?
#End#

#Literature_38#
Slimeantha
(Come on, throw me a bone here! >~<)
#End#

#Literature_39#
Vaselle
That sounds... really nice, actually...
#End#

#Literature_40#
Slimeantha
(YES!!!!)
#End#

#Literature_41#
Slimeantha
Ok, sounds good. I'll write that up ASAP! Thanks so much for talking with me Vaselle, it'll really help me out.
#End#

#Literature_42#
Vaselle
No, thanks for talking with me. Um... 0////0
#End#

#Literature_43#
Slimeantha
What's up?
#End#

#Literature_44#
Vaselle
You're not a member, but if you want to... hang out here, after school, feel free to come by... I think we could be... um...
#End#

#Literature_45#
Slimeantha
...friends?
#End#

#Literature_46#
Vaselle
...Only if you want to... 0////0
#End#

#Literature_47#
Slimeantha
For sure! I'll definitely come by again!
#End#

#Literature_48#
Vaselle
:D Thanks Slimeantha...
#End#

#Literature_49#
Slimeantha
Oh, uh, I almost forgot, how did you know my name?
#End#

#Literature_50#
Vaselle
Um... I've uh, seen you around... >///<
#End#

#Literature_51#
Slimeantha
(Huh, I guess I'm not as invisible as I thought! Well, I am transparent, but whatever.)
#End#

#Literature_52#
Slimeantha
Oh I getcha! Ok, see you when I see you friendo!
#End#

#Literature_53#
Vaselle
Bye!
#End#

#Endblocks#
Slimeantha
(That went really well, actually. I don't know if I made any headway voting wise, but I'm talking to people, and that's what counts!)
