The prestigious Ave Protista Academy for Young Slimes opens its gates for another semester.

#TWO#
Narrator
Many young slimes come each year for a shot at greatness and in the pursuit of higher learning.
#END#

#THREE#
Narrator
But one slime in particular feels left out. A bit shy. A bit unprepared for the promise that the new year brings.
#END#

#FOUR#
Narrator
Maybe she just needs a little push in the right direction to leave her mark on the school. Maybe she'll be a bigger help than anyone could have imagined...
#END#

#FIVE#
Slimeantha
Okay. Okay, girl, you can do this. Just go in and introduce yourself to her. Easy as pie.

Well, maybe she'll forget about it and I can try and talk to her... a month from now.

Slimeantha
AHH! ...Oh, hi Jellia.
#END#

#TWELVE#
Jellia
How's it goin', cutieblorp? Enjoying roaming the beautiful, shiny halls of Protista again~?
#END#

#THIRTEEN#
Slimeantha
Not quite... Operation Have-A-Not-Totally-Dead-Social-Life is off to a bad start.
#END#

#FOURTEEN#
Jellia
Aww, I'm sorry - social stuff can be super-rough if you're not used to it yet.
#END#

#FIFTEEN#
Jellia
But I believe in ya, girl! You're gonna be swimming in friends this year! Actually swimming in them! A giant mass of friend-goo!!
#END#

#SIXTEEN#
Slimeantha
Jelliaaaaa you're embarrassing me! >.<
#END#

#SEVENTEEN#
Slimeantha
But I appreciate your encouragement. I'm going to give it my all this year and leave my mark on this school.
#END#

#SEVENTEEN#
Jellia
That's the spirit! Go, go, go! I'll be right behind you all the way!
#END#

#EIGHTEEN#
Jellia
...I'll always be here for you, Slimeantha. <3
#END#

#NINETEEN#
Slimeantha
Huh? Sorry, I missed that - what was that again?
#END#

#TWENTY#
Jellia
Oh, um... nothing! >///<
#END#

#TWENTYONE#
Jellia
Anyway, gossip! You probably haven't been in the loop since you've been out of town for the whole summer, so let me fill you in!
#END#

#TWENTYTWO#
Jellia
Let's see, where to start... Ooh!
#END#

#TWENTYTHREE#
Jellia
Biggest news: The class president fell down a storm drain just days before the semester started! She's going to be in the hospital until she grows back enough body mass to come back to school!
#END#

#TWENTYFOUR#
Slimeantha
Oh no! That poor girl, is she going to be alright?
#END#

#TWENTYFIVE#
Jellia
Yeah, thankfully her core wasn't damaged, so she'll be fine - she just needs some good ol' R&R.
#END#

#TWENTYSIX#
Slimeantha
But wait, who's going to be the class president in the meantime? We never elect a VP, and there's a lot of stuff that has to be sorted out near the beginning of the year.
#END#

#TWENTYSEVEN#
Jellia
Believe it or not, there's gonna be a whole new election right away!
#END#

#TWENTYEIGHT#
Slimeantha
What?! But... but the semester only just started!
#END#

#TWENTYNINE#
Jellia
That's the breaks, I guess. Because of the rush, I don't know anyone who is even running for it. No one wants to put together a campaign that soon. :/
#END#

#THIRTY#
Jellia

#THIRTYONE#
Jellia
Heeeeeeey, this gives me an idea~ >w>
#END#

#THIRTYTWO#
Slimeantha
???
#END#

#THIRTYTHREE#
Jellia
YOU should run for class president!
#END#

#THIRTYFOUR#
Slimeantha
Wh-what?! Did you hit your core or something? There's no way I could do that!!
#END#

#THIRTYFIVE#
Jellia
Aw c'mon - you could totally do this! Besides, you wanted to have an excuse to reach out to folks and make friends, right? You said you wanted to make an impact on the school, right? :D
#END#

#THIRTYSIX#
Slimeantha
Well... I mean I guess...
#END#

#THIRTYSEVEN#
Jellia
You could buddy up with all the school's club leaders to get to know them and get their support!
#END#

#THIRTYEIGHT#
Slimeantha
But wouldn't that be weird, just talking to people for political reasons? I wanna make friends, not just... constituents.
#END#

#THIRTYNINE#
Jellia
No reason ya can't do both - real support comes from trust and friendship anyway!
#END#

#FOURTY#
Jellia
Trust me. You could totally do this if you wanted. I'm not trying to force you into doing this if you don't want to, but... I really think it would help.
#END#

#FOURTYONE#
Jellia
I just want you to be happy, Slimeantha. <3
#END#

#FOURTYTWO#
Slimeantha
...
#END#

#FOURTYTHREE#
Slimeantha
...Okay. You're right, I can do this. I'm going to make friends, reach out, and run for class president!
#END#

#FOURTYFOUR#
Jellia
Whoo-hoo! You go, girl! Say it again! You're not just gonna RUN for class prez, you're gonna BE class prez!
#END#

#FOURTYFIVE#
Slimeantha
I, Slimeantha Embryolle, am going to be class president.
#END#

#FOURTYSIX#
Jellia
Louder! With feeling!

I, Slimeantha Embryolle, am going to be class president!

Narrator
The pipes interrupted by shaking and rumbling in the classroom sink, straining and clunking loudly, before spitting out a large mass of goo onto the floor!
#END#

#FIFTYONE#
Narrator
All the girls crowded around the goo as it formed back up into a slender person-shape.
#END#

#FIFTYTWO#
Roozelyn
Say hello to your new classmate, girls! Make way for Roozelyn!
#END#

#FIFTYTHREE#
Narrator
The new girl sauntered confidently to the front of the classroom, hopping up onto the teacher's desk, much to her dismay.
#END#

#FIFTYFOUR#
Roozelyn
I'd introduce myself, but my reputation likely proceeds me - my mother is the CEO of the Myxo-Gastro Group, and she saw fit to send me to only the finest academy in the region.
#END#

#FIFTYFIVE#
Jellia
*whispers* Myxo-Gastro? The soda company?!
#END#

#FIFTYSIX#
Roozelyn
I am also pleased to announce that I will be your new class president! I have been researching this school for some time, and I have plenty of ideas for changes to benefit the student body. Look forward to my campagin's grand premiere later today!
#END#

#FIFTYSEVEN#
Roozelyn
And to show you how much I care, I've provided a little surprise to break the ice...
#END#

#FIFTYEIGHT#
Roozelyn
Free Pepsilt for the entire class!!
#END#

#FIFTYNINE#
Narrator
Some slimes in black suits and sunglasses roll a soda fountain into the classroom as everyone cheers and rushes to get a drink.
#END#

#SIXTY#
Jellia 
H-hey you! The campaigns haven't even started yet! Y...you're not the class president until the people decide it!
#END#

#SIXTYONE#
Slimeantha 
*whispers, already retreating into a blob-form* JELLIA WHAT ARE YOU DOING
#END#

#SIXTYTWO#
Jellia 
Yeah, that's right, I'm talkin' to you! You think you can waltz in here like you're the slickest slime on the block, but we hardly even know you! My friend Slimeantha's gonna whup your core in the election!
#END#

#SIXTYTHREE#
Narrator 
Roozelyn gracefully descends from the teacher's desk, approaching Slimeantha, staring her down, eyes locking only a few inches apart, and never for a second losing her piercing, confident glare.
#END#

#SIXTYFOUR#
Roozelyn 
Competiton? How droll. This should be fun - let it not be said that I take a rival's challenge laying down - you have yourself a race, my dear little puddle.
#END#

#SIXTYFIVE#
Slimeantha 
*frozen in terror*
#END#

#SIXTYSIX#
Teacher 
Um... may I start class yet?
#END#

#SIXTYSEVEN#
Jellia 
Okay so I admit that in retrospect, maybe it WASN'T a good idea for me to provoke her. I still stand by the fact that she's a pushy meanie, though. >~<
#END#

#SIXTYEIGHT#
Jellia 
But... are you going to be okay, Slimeantha? That was probably a lot to take in.
#END#

#SIXTYNICE#
Jellia 
I would totally understand if you wanted to drop out of the race. She seems like she'll be a tough cookie.
#END#

#SEVENTY#
Jellia 
But whatever you decide, I'll be right by your side the whole way! We'll stick together like glue!
#END#

#SEVENTYONE#
Slimeantha 
You really think I have a chance, Jellia? You're not just saying that to be nice?
#END#

#SEVENTYTWO#
Jellia 
Of COURSE I do, silly! I believe in you one-bajillion percent times infinity!
#END#

#SEVENTYTHREE#
Slimeantha 
...
#END#

#SEVENTYFOUR#
Slimeantha 
...I'm still in. >:)
#END#

#SEVENTYFIVE#
Jellia 
Attagirl! We're gonna do great! I'll start working on campaign stuffs right away!
#END#

#SEVENTYSIX#
Jellia 
But first, you're gonna have to start putting yourself out there. How about you do what we talked about earlier and visit one of the school's four clubs?
#END#

#SEVENTYSEVEN#
Slimeantha 
We really only have four clubs?
#END#

#SEVENTYEIGHT#
Jellia 
Have you SEEN our homework load lately?
#END#

#SEVENTYNINE#
Slimeantha 
Touche.
#END#

#EIGHTY#
Slimeantha 
I might as well go introduce myself, at least.
#END#

#EIGHTYONE#
Jellia 
Yeah, they're nice folks - they don't bite! ...Most of them, anyway.
#END#

#EIGHTYTWO#
Jellia 
Which club will you visit today?
#END#

#START_EIGHTYTWO_Choice_1#
Swimming Club
Sounds like fun, and good exercise.
#END#

#START_EIGHTYTWO_Choice_2#
Literature Club
I do enjoy a good book.
#END#

#START_EIGHTYTWO_Choice_3#
Paranormal Club
That's a thing?
#END#

#START_EIGHTYTWO_Choice_4#
Cooking Club
Useful skills, and yummy treats when you're done! Mm~!
#END#

#EIGHTYTHREE#
Slimeantha 
Here I go - wish me luck, Jellia!
#END#

#EIGHTYFOUR#
Jellia 
*leans forward and hugs tenderly* You can do this. I'll be cheering you on all the way.
