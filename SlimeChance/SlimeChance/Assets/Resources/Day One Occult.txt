(Huh, I didn't realize this creepy shed was actually part of the school... I'm getting a little nervous about this... >_<;)

#Occult_02#
Slimeantha
(Well, it's now or never... Wait, that's weird, the lights are all out.)
#End#

#Occult_03#
Slimeantha
He-hello? Is anyone home?
#End#

#Occult_04#
???
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee... What foolish denizen of the waking world has entered my palace of nightmares?
#End#

#Occult_05#
Slimeantha
EEEEEEEEEEEEK!!! I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't allowed here! >A< 
#End#

#Occult_06#
???
Shhhhhh... Shh-shh-shhhhhh... Don't be afraid my dear little comrade, I know why you're here?
#End#

#Occult_07#
Slimeantha
You-you do? Wait... comrade?
#End#

#Occult_08#
???
Comrade in the quest for the... OCCULT. You're here because you're like me... An outcast, living on the fringes of the known world... Shh-shh-shhhhhhh... Don't cry dear. It's ok now.
#End#

#Occult_09#
Slimeantha
I'm- I'm not crying.
#End#

#Occult_10#

Shush... No more tears. Sluzanne will guide you in search of the paranormal, and together, we will use the power we find in these dark corners to-

#Occult_11#
Slimeantha
Oh, wait, here's the light switch.
#End#

#Occult_12#
Sluzanne
Aaah!
#End#

#Occult_13#
Slimeantha
Wow, this club looks more... normal than I expected. You even have a fair amount of members! I didn't realize ghost hunting was this popular-
#End#

#Occult_14#
Slimeantha
Um, are you ok?
#End#

#Occult_15#
Sluzanne
Aaaaa... My eyes just sting, I didn't think you'd just... turn on the light!
#End#

#Occult_16#
Slimeantha
Oh! I'm sorry... I didn't mean to spoil your fun.
#End#

#Occult_17#
Sluzanne
Are you sure? I mean, where's your occult SPIRIT? Half the battle in believing in the unknown is having the right ATTITUDE, you know.
#End#

#Occult_18#
Sluzanne
Maybe it's generational, the first-years just don't believe in cryptids and ghosts the way they did when I started at this school. 
#End#

#Occult_19#
Slimeantha
Oh, well, um, I don't actually believe in this stuff... ^^;
#End#

#Occult_20#
Sluzanne
Hm? Wait, I think I know why you're here- hold on! Let me gather my psychic energies. Hmmmmmmmm... HMMMMmmmmm... HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.........
#End#

#Occult_21#
Slimeantha
(She looks like she's gonna pop... I hope this is worth it...)
#End#

#Occult_22#
Slimeantha
Um, I'm here for the-
#End#

#Occult_23#
Sluzanne
DON'T TELL ME. THE PICTURE IS FORMING I N  M Y  M I N D ...
#End#

#Occult_24#
Slimeantha
Oh, uh, ok. (I guess it's ok as long as she's having fun...)
#End#

#Occult_25#
Sluzanne
Hm... you're here on... OFFICIAL busines... right?
#End#

#Occult_26#
Slimeantha
You got it!
#End#

#Occult_27#
Sluzanne
Hee-hee-hee! Of course. Now, let's see- your face... it betrays an association. The student council, yes?
#End#

#Occult_28#
Slimeantha
Wow! Yeah, you're right.
#End#

#Occult_29#
Sluzanne
I see. Well then... If my predictions are right...
#End#

#Occult_30#
Sluzanne
PLEASE DON'T TAKE OUR SHED FROM US. WE'LL PAY THE FINES AS SOON AS WE CAN, BUT PLEASE, THIS IS OUR ONLY REPRIVE FROM THE WAKING  W O R L D !!!
#End#

#Occult_31#
Slimeantha
(Oh my gosh that got intense FAST! She's practically begging me, so she must think I'm already part of the council 0_0;)
#End#

#Occult_32#
Sluzanne
OUR OUTSTANDING FINES WILL BE PAID, SO PLEASE, HAVE MERCY ON US... PLEASE SLIME GODDESS, WE BEG YOU!
#End#

#Occult_33#
Slimeantha
Um, I'm not actually with the student council... 
#End#

#Occult_34#
Sluzanne
...Ahem. Please disregard what you just heard. So, you're here for the council election then?
#End#

#Occult_35#
Slimeantha
Uh, yes. I'm running for president and I wanted to talk with you about the Occult Club's voting stance- 
#End#

#Occult_36#
Sluzanne
We refuse. 
#End#

#Occult_37#
Slimeantha
...Excuse me? I don't understand.
#End#

#Occult_38#
Slimeantha
The Society for Paranormal, Occult, and Obscure Knowledge Education recognizes no mortal slime as superior to any other. We're all gooey puddles in the vast ocean of the absolute.
#End#

#Occult_39#
Sluzanne
So, each year we abstain from voting. Sorry, but you'll get nothing from talking to me when it comes to the mortal world.
#End#

#Occult_40#
Slimeantha
(Wow. Just like that, a whole day wasted. I'm sure if I'd asked any of the second or third years they would've told me about this, but I had to just jump right into it...)
#End#

#Occult_41#
Slimeantha
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to infringe upon your club time. I'll take off now. Thanks for talking to me.
#End#

#Occult_42#
Slimeantha
(Maybe I can still talk to one of the other clubs before the day is over. I don't want to give up yet, but this is probably going to be a big blow to my chances >~<)
#End#

#Occult_43#
Sluzanne
Wait!
#End#

#Occult_44#
Slimeantha
...Um, what's up?
#End#

#Occult_45#
Sluzanne
You're just giving up? This is what I'm talking about, ATTITUDE! You think just because something hasn't happened before means it never will!
#End#

#Occult_46#
Slimeantha
So, wait, I'm confused? I thought you said you wouldn't be voting?
#End#

#Occult_47#
Sluzanne
Hmph. The winds of fate blow in many directions, little first year. What once was, may not be on the morrow.
#End#

#Occult_48#
Slimeantha
...You want me to come back to talk with you more? Is that what you're saying?
#End#

#Occult_49#
Sluzanne
...If it pleases you, and the stars allowed such things to take place... Yes, I would find that, um, agreeable.
#End#

#Occult_50#
Slimeantha
(Maybe I still have a shot with her!)
#End#

#Occult_51#
Sluzanne
Ok, sounds great! I'll come again some time, I promise. Oh, I'm Slimeantha, by the way.
#End#

#Occult_52#
Slimeantha
But I'm sure you knew that already ;3c
#End#

#Occult_53#
Sluzanne
Ahem. Yes, um, of course. And, if you wouldn't mind, before you come next time, listen to this?
#End#

#Occult_54#
Slimeantha
(Ooh, a business card. Fancy.)
#End#

#Occult_55#
Slimeantha
"The S.P.O.O.K.E. Blobcast?"
#End#

#Occult_56#
Sluzanne
New episodes every Friday! The official club's blobcast. If you're interested in anything on there, feel free to, uh, let me know...
#End#

#Occult_57#
Slimeantha
Sounds great! I'll listen to it when I get home.
#End#

#Occult_58#
Sluzanne
Hee-hee-hee... Listen to it at the witching hour, and you may hear secrets in blobcast~!
#End#

#Occult_59#
Slimeantha
Uh. Ok, sounds good!
#End#

#Occult_60#
Slimeantha
(That was a bit weird, but at least it seems like she's open to more discussion...)
