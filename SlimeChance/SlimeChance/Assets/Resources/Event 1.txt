SCENE 4: DAY 2 - AFTER CLUB - HALLWAY

#ONE#
Slimeantha 
Okay, things are off to a good start! The club leaders seem nice enough, and even seem like they might support me in the campaign.
#END#

#TWO#
Jellia 
Told ya, girl~ you’ve got this in the bag!
#END#

#THREE#
Slimeantha 
Yeah. I just need to keep at this and hope they’ll show up when voting time comes.
#END#

#FOUR#
Jellia 
Well, the debate at the end of next week will be the REAL important part, so it’s best to hope they’ll sho up for that, too.
#END#

#FIVE#
Slimeantha 
D...debate? D:
#END#

#SIX#
Jellia 
You... didn’t know there’d be a debate?
#END#

#SEVEN#
Jellia 
...
#END#

#EIGHT#
Jellia 
...Oh, dear. .-.
#END#

#NINE#
Jellia 
Well, don’t worry, you can still do this! It’s just one debate!
#END#

#TEN#
Slimeantha 
...In front of the whole school, with lots of bright lights shining right through me along with the stares of everyone in the school as I stand across from the girl who could have the school bought out and demolished with her mom’s company at a moment’s notice oh gods oh gods
#END#

#ELEVEN#
Jellia 
No! Bad anxiety! You can’t let this psyche you out like that!
#END#

#TWELVE#
Jellia 
You’re going to mop the floor with that mean ol’ Roozelyn, even on stage!
#END#

#THIRTEEN#
Slimeantha 
Even if she’s scary?
#END#

#FOURTEEN#
Jellia 
She won’t be scary when you’re ready for her! The best strategy right now is to prepare!
#END#

#FIFTEEN#
Slimeantha 
...Okay, you’re right - I’ve got to stop cowering every time I think of this.
#END#

#SIXTEEN#
Slimeantha 
So what do I need to know for the debates?
#END#

#SEVENTEEN#
Jellia 
Really anything can happen during a debate, but the main thing you need to know is what the people want from their school.
#END#

#EIGHTEEN#
Jellia 
Pay attention when you’re talking with club leaders so that you can tell when they want something.
#END#

#NINETEEN#
Jellia 
It shouldn’t be too hard, but just know that sometimes you’ll need to know them well enough before they tell you what they really want.
#END#

#TWENTY#
Slimeantha 
So it’s just a matter of getting to know them, right? They’re just regular people like the rest of us.
#END#

#TWENTYONE#
Jellia 
Yeah! Now you’re getting it! Just talk to ‘em, and it’ll be fine~!
#END#

#TWENTYTWO#
Slimeantha 
I have just under two weeks to prepare, and I’m going to make the most out of them.
#END#

#TWENTYTHREE#
Jellia 
I’ll wave my sign around the whole time to cheer you on! XD
#END#

#TWENTYFOUR#
Slimeantha 
Haha! Careful not to knock anyone out with that thing!
#END#

#TWENTYFIVE#
Jellia 
FOOL, THAT IS MY BEST STRATEGY! >:D
