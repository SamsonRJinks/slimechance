SCENE 6: DAY 4 - AFTER CLUB - HALLWAY

#ONE#
Slimeantha 
Everyone else just asked for aqn extension for the homework, but I didn’t really think we needed it, so I said it had already been a week but for some reason, they just kept glaring at me - am I doing something wrong?

Slimeantha paused as she overheard some slimes standing in the hallway, trading gossip with her name attached.

#THREE#
Random Slime 1
Oh my glob, did you HEAR about what people have been saying about that one nobody girl running for class president?
#END#

#FOUR#
Random Slime 2
YES! Like, I heard she wants to take away break time and take out all the oil in the lunch pizza! I’m like, 80% oil - I need that grease!
#END#

#FIVE#
Random Slime 1
Uuuugh, she sounds like the absolute WORST.
#END#

#SIX#
Random Slime 2
You’re not gonna vote for her, right?
#END#

#SEVEN#
Random Slime 1
It’s like, student government - who cares enough to vote either way?
#END#

#EIGHT#
Slimeantha
*sniff* *whimper*
#END#

#NINE#
Jellia
*holds Slimeantha close* It’s okay, Slimeantha - those meanies don’t know what they’re talking about? Where did they even hear that?
#END#

#TEN#
Slimeantha
But... why would they say that? Did I do something wrong? I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it, I’m sorry!
#END#

#ELEVEN#
Jellia
You didn’t do anything wrong! That’s just a nasty rumor that Roozelyn’s cronies must be spreaidng! Of all the nerve!!
#END#

#TWELVE#
Jellia
HEY, YOU TWO!
#END#

Random Slime 1
Um, exsqueeze me?

#FOURTEEN#
Jellia
Don’t pick on Slimeantha - those rumors aren’t true, and she did nothing w-
#END#

#FIFTEEN#
Roozelyn
She did absolutely nothing wrong, you two. What you heard was an exaggeration, at least. I may still be the far superior candidate, but I will not tolerate this flagarant of a flasehood against an opponent.
#END#

#SIXTEEN#
Random Slime 1
Ah! Uh, Roozelyn! Where did you come from?!
#END#

#SEVENTEEN#
Random Slime 2
Okay, okay, everything’s fine! If she says they’re not true, then they’re not true, hahahaha! Well, we’ll be going, now, seeyouaroundbye!
#END#

#EIGHTEEN#
Jellia
What’s the big idea, ya big drip?
#END#

#NINETEEN#
Roozelyn
*glares at Jellia* My apologies. My PR team seems to have missed the memo to cease the rumor-spreading plans.
#END#

#TWENTY#
Jellia
That doesn’t change the fact that you wanted to do it in the first place! Don’t act so high and mighty!
#END#

#TWENTYONE#
Roozelyn
Don’t provoke a woman who just extended you a momentary olive branch. Let’s just pretend this whole kerfuffle never happened.
#END#

#TWENTYTWO#
Roozelyn
I have things to attend to - calls to make, events to coordinate, and maybe even a class or two if I can fit such frivolous things in.
#END#

#TWENTYTHREE#
Jellia
This isn’t over, you! We’re still going to win this thing!
#END#

#TWENTYFOUR#
Roozelyn
Hmmph.
#END#

#TWENTYFIVE#
Slimeantha
Wait, Roozelyn...
#END#

#TWENTYSIX#
Roozelyn
Hmmph?
#END#

#TWENTYSEVEN#
Slimeantha
Thank you. I don’t appreciate you wanting to spread rumors about me, but thank you for calling them off.
#END#

#TWENTYEIGHT#
Slimeantha
I’m sure you’re a good person underneath all that brash exterior.
#END#

#TWENTYNINE#
Roozelyn
...C-come now, I know full well you don’t believe that. You know I’m terrible. Don’t convince yourself otherwise, or you’ll start to lose focus on the campaign.
#END#

#THIRTY#
Slimeantha
???
#END#

#THIRTYONE#
Roozelyn
I’ll be taking my leave now.
#END#

#THIRTYTWO#
Slimeantha
Wait, Roozelyn...
#END#

#THIRTYTHREE#
Jellia
What was with her just then?
#END#

#THIRTYFOUR#
Slimeantha
I don’t know. But she still seems as determined as ever, in spite of giving us a break.
#END#

#THIRTYFIVE#
Slimeantha
Jellia... will everyone still think about those rumors even if I become president? Will everyone still think of those nasty things when they think of me?
#END#

#THIRTYSIX#
Jellia
Oh dear, oh dear... c’mere, it’s alright *hugs tightly*
#END#

#THIRTYSEVEN#
Jellia
Everyone will forget about it in no time, you just wait. And your friends will never believe that junk in the first place.
#END#

#THIRTYEIGHT#
Jellia
And of course... you’ll always have me. You mean the world to me, and I’ll always be right here by your side to support you. <3

Narrator
The two girls embraced in the hall for what felt like forever before Jellia tenderly moved back, looking at Slimeantha with her usual big, goo-fy grin.
#END#

#FOURTYONE#
Jellia
Hey, howzabout we go back to my dorm room? Oh! You haven’t met my pet ferret yet, you totally should while we’re there!

That sounds lovely, Jellia. <3

The two girls slid out the building, hand-in-hand, enjoying the quiet reprieve. Jellia nonchalantly tore down a Roozelyn poster on their way out.
