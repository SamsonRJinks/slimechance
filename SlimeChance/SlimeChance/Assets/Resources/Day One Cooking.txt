(Ok, Jellia said the Cooking Club would be in the Home Ec room...)

I SAID FOUR CLOVES OF GARLIC, WHY DO I ONLY SEE TWO CLOVES IN THIS BOWL?!
#End#

#Cooking_02#
Slimeantha
Eek! (There's a milky-yellow slime girl yelling at all the juniors. Is this the right room?)
#End#

#Cooking_03#
???
What're you even DOING in the Cooking Club if you can't even make a simple sauce?!
#End#

#Cooking_04#
Slimeantha
(I guess I'm in the right place, but I didn't expect cooking to be this... angry! >0<)
#End#

#Cooking_05#
???
I don't CARE if the recipe says two, you always use more than the recipe calls for when it comes to garlic! Listen to your senior, got it?
#End#

#Cooking_06#
Slimeantha
Uh...
#End#

#Cooking_07#
???
Yeah? What, you a new member? Sign-up sheet's over there, aprons on the rack.
#End#

#Cooking_08#
Slimeantha
(Ah, this was a bad idea, I'm not used to making new friends... But I'm not backing off! This is the year when I change myself.)
#End#

#Cooking_09#
Slimeantha
Uh, I'm Slimeantha! It's nice to meet you, um...? 
#End#

Paula. Cooking Club President, 3rd Year.
#End#

#Cooking_11#
Slimeantha
(Huh, maybe she's not as angry as she seems-?)
#End#

#Cooking_12#
Paula
...and apparently the only person with any TASTE around here! WHAT are you putting in that caponata?!
#End#

#Cooking_13#
Slimeantha
Um... 
#End#

#Cooking_14#
Paula
Yeah? C'mon, spit it out kid.
#End#

#Cooking_15#
Slimeantha
(Don't call me a kid! You're even shorter than I am! =_=;)
#End#

#Cooking_16#
Slimeantha
I'm running for student council president this year! I was hoping the Cooking Club could, uh...
#End#

#Cooking_17#
Paula
Oh, great, another student council election. What, you came here shopping for votes? Well, you're competition talked to me THIS MORNING, so I think you're already behind, don't you?
#End#

#Cooking_18#
Slimeantha
(You mean she already knew who to talk to? Darnit, that girl must be well connected! -3-)
#End#

#Cooking_19#
Paula
Look, you seem sweet and all, but... you don't look like you've got the stock for student council president.
#End#

#Cooking_20#
Slimeantha
Ha ha, yeah, I guess that's true. (Gah, I feel so stupid! I should just end my bid right now!) Sorry for bothering you. I'll just leave-
#End#

#Cooking_21#
Slimeantha
Wait, what is that SMELL? That's delicious...
#End#

#Cooking_22#
Paula
Oh, uh, thanks. It's nothing much, just a little, uh, butternut squash soup...
#End#

#Cooking_23#
Slimeantha
(Wait, is she blushing? She's stirring the soup and keeps looking at me with this hopeful look on her face. Maybe...)
#End#

#Cooking_24#
Slimeantha
Can I try it-
#End#

#Cooking_25#
Paula
OH, WELL, IF YOU INSIST! 
#End#

#Cooking_26#
Slimeantha
(She's giving me some soup... It doesn't look like the other club members are making this, so maybe it's a personal project of hers for the day?)
#End#

#Cooking_27#
Slimeantha
MMMM... It's super thick, but it makes me feel nice and warm, like I'm near a fire on a winter day...
#End#

#Cooking_28#
Paula
Exactly! That's what I love about homestyle cooking, it just fills you up in a special way! 
#End#

#Cooking_29#
Paula
Sure wish I could show the other members how to make it though...
#End#

#Cooking_30#
Slimeantha
Wait, are you not allowed to show them new recipes?
#End#

#Cooking_31#
Paula
Well, sort of. Council rules, we're only allowed to cook with cafeteria food for club stuff, so I have to make use of whatever's in the fridge down there... which is usually Nutri-Goo and Eezy-Cheezy... Blech. DX
#End#

#Cooking_32#
Slimeantha
But that's a dumb rule! You should be able to cook whatever you want!
#End#

#Cooking_33#
Paula
Huh. You think?
#End#

#Cooking_34#
Slimeantha
Absolutely! Especially when you're making something this delicious!
#End#

#Cooking_35#
Paula
Oh man, delicious huh. Well, maybe... I mean, I guess, if you want, you could come by again some time...
#End#

#Cooking_36#
Slimeantha
Sure, that sounds great!
#End#

#Cooking_37#
Slimeantha
(Oh, there's the bell! I better get going!)
#End#

#Cooking_38#
Slimeantha
Thank you so much Paula-
#End#

#Cooking_39#
Paula
Oh no, no, thank you. If you ever want to try more of my genius- I mean, delicious cooking, please come by and sample it again.
#End#

#Cooking_40#
Slimeantha
Uh, yeah, of course! See ya!
#End#

#Cooking_41#
Slimeantha
(I don't know if I got her vote, but I think I've opened a door here! Thank goodness!)
#End#

#EndBlocks#
Slimeantha
(Better meet back up with Jellia. It wasn't a lot of progress, but I'm talking to people at least! :3)
